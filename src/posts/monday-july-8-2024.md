# How to Become Carbon Neutral

We all pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, one way or another. That could be through driving, flying, or by simply existing in our homes.

I will paint a hypothetical scenario of my carbon emissions and different ways in which I can achieve carbon neutrality. My only goal in life, for some unknown reason, is to announce to everyone that "I'm carbon neutral".

## Problem Scenario

Assume that I only emit carbon when I drive my car and let's say I emit **4 tonnes** of carbon each year by doing so.

## Goal

I need to find a way so that I can claim that I'm emitting a total of **0 tonnes** of CO2 into the atmosphere.

### Solution 1 - Stop driving

This is the most obvious solution. Since I'm emitting no carbon into the atmosphere, I can claim "I'm Carbon Neutral".

However, in reality I will not be doing so as I live in an american-esque dystopia where nothing is in walking distance.

### Solution 2 - Plant trees (A lot of them)

I will not stop driving but instead I will plant an excessive amount of trees to **offset** my CO2 emissions.

Roughly, 31-46 trees are needed to prevent a tonne of C02 (it's more complicated than that in reality but this isn't a science lesson). Lets take the upper limit (46) and since I'm emitting 4 tonnes of C02. I simply need to plant **184 trees** to offset my carbon emissions.

**Carbon emissions overview:**

4 tonnes emitted + 4 tonnes prevented = 0 tonnes added

I'm now carbon neutral, as I haven't increased the overall amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

I will simply plant these **184 trees** in my parent's backyard.

### Solution 3 - Plant trees (A lot of them but nefariously)

I need to plant 184 trees to offset my carbon emissions. My parent's however every year plant 200 trees in their backyard. I will just help them to plant 184 of them and boom I'm carbon neutral.

I'll tell everyone I helped my parent and then claim I'm carbon neutral. Wow, I'm so smart.

### Solution 4 - Convince my parent's to not burn down their existing trees

Let's say my parents have a total of 1000 trees already planted in their backyard. Lets say hypothetically that burning 100 trees releases 4 tonnes of C02 (doesn't matter if it's true, not a science lesson).

I go up to my parents and say "do not burn 100 trees" and then walk away. They had no intentions of burning any trees to begin with though.

Then I tell everyone that I stopped my parents from burning 100 trees and prevented 4 tonnes of C02 going into the atmosphere. Hence, I'm carbon neutral :).

## Which Solution Should I Choose?

The right answer is 1 or 2 but most companies who claim to be carbon-neutral pick solutions that sound more like 3 or 4. The danger with solutions 3 and 4 is that I haven't really done anything to help the environment.

In solution 3, the trees would have been planted regardless of my efforts. Also, solution 4 is a mere scam where I made up a heroic effort to prevent carbon emissions.

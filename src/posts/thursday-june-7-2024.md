# Why I Became a Programmer

Programming is an art that tends to be overshadowed by glitz and glamour.

Money, status, and respect. Some of the few keywords that come to mind right before you apply to an overly-competitive CS program at some pretentious university.

Where the main selling point is that most people wont succeed and for some reason this isn't a knock on the school's teaching abilities but a marketing scheme to promote an all-exclusive club.

This sounds miserable, so why would anyone embark on such a voyage? Why would I knowingly pursue such a career?

What if I told you that there was an artistic beauty, ethereal delicacy and complicated elegance to writing code. What if I told you that there was no greater joy than solving a problem that you spent the entire week on.

The heart of programming to me is problem solving and this is what drove me to the field.

I love solving problems. I love learning about algorithms, or even making my own silly variations to solve modern problems.

To some essence problem solving gives me a purpose, an inherent worth. I'm not completely useless because I can tell you the cheapest flight from Toronto to Japan with my algorithm.

However, corporate programming can be quite un-rewarding. This isn't the fault of the field but the profit motive in some sense. As a result, you end up writing a bunch of software with zero societal importance but for some reason it makes the company money. However, I will explore the qualms of modern programming in another post.
